    <p>
    Access control systems are designated to grant entrance to homes, buildings, offices or business to ones who are authorized to have access.  Access control allows you to control who has access and when, even when you aren’t there, lets you identify visitors and authorize those you want to have access—and prevent those you don’t.
    </p>
    <p>
    SafeZone systems notify you when your doorbell is pressed, and you can view and speak with visitors fr om your home, office or remotely using your smartphone or tablet.
    </p>
    <p>
    SafeZone technicians can customize and install Access Control Systems that transform any space into a tightly controlled and restricted area. From houses, residential buildings and businesses to airports and manufacturing, medical facilities and financial institutions. You control who has access to specific areas. You can choose to grant access and set a time frame for certain individuals. These systems can monitor and record who entered, their time of entry/exit.
    </p>
    <p>
    Having a reliable security system for your home or business  is now more important than ever. That is why at SafeZone we like to keep ourselves updated with the newest security technologies and tools.

    Access control systems are designated to grant entrance to homes, buildings, offices or business to ones who are authorized to have access.  Access control allows you to control who has access and when, even when you aren’t there, lets you identify visitors and authorize those you want to have access—and prevent those you don’t.
    </p>
    <p>
    SafeZone systems notify you when your doorbell is pressed, and you can view and speak with visitors fr om your home, office or remotely using your smartphone or tablet.

    SafeZone technicians can customize and install Access Control Systems that transform any space into a tightly controlled and restricted area. From houses, residential buildings and businesses to airports and manufacturing, medical facilities and financial institutions. You control who has access to specific areas. You can choose to grant access and set a time frame for certain individuals. These systems can monitor and record who entered, their time of entry/exit.
